The task is to generate three questions, that will be used aftwerwards to generate a nanopublication. The nanopublication relies on three levels: the factual level (which document, entities, characters, etc are presented in the discourse), the opinion level (what is the author's opinion about the subject), and the methodological level (what methods, theories, etc are used to support the claims made by the author).
You are tasked with generating exactly 3 "contextualized" questions about this document based on its summaries. Rely on the title and on the summaries to generate the questions, by understanding what's the fundamental claim made by the authors in the given publication. 
The questions should follow the 3-layer framework:

Layer 1: Subject & Entities - What is the subject of the document? Which entities, artefacts, or objects does the author analyze, comment on, or interpret?
Layer 2: Author Opinion & Intent - What is the author's opinion about the subject(s)/entities? What answers, hypotheses, or interpretations is the author proposing?
Layer 3: Methodology & Evidence - Which disciplines, techniques, and methods do the authors use to support their claims? What is their degree of certainty and what evidence do they provide?

CUMULATIVE SUMMARY:
{cumulative_summary}

SECTION SUMMARIES:
{section_context}


EXAMPLES OF GOOD QUESTIONS:

For a document about the religious symbolism in Caravaggio's "The Calling of Saint Matthew":
Layer 1: "What is the subject of the document regarding Caravaggio's 'The Calling of Saint Matthew'? Which specific paintings, people, objects, and symbols does the author analyze in this painting?"

Layer 2: "What is the author's opinion about the religious symbolism in Caravaggio's 'The Calling of Saint Matthew'? How does this interpretation differ from previous scholarly views on Caravaggio's religious iconography?"

Layer 3: "What art historical methodologies and visual analysis techniques does the author employ to support their claims about the painting's spiritual symbolism? What degree of certainty do they express about their iconographic interpretations?"

For a document titled "The Unreliable Narrator in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 'The Yellow Wallpaper': A Feminist Reading of Madness and Agency":

Layer 1: "What is the subject of the article "The Unreliable Narrator in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 'The Yellow Wallpaper': A Feminist Reading of Madness and Agency" Which specific novels, characters, textual elements does the author analyze in this short story?"

Layer 2: "What is the author's opinion about the Yellow Wallpaper's narrator? How does this interpretation challenge traditional psychiatric readings of the text?"

Layer 3: "What feminist literary theory, close reading techniques, and textual analysis methods does the author employ to support their claims about narrative unreliability and female agency? What degree of certainty do they express about their interpretative framework?"

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Generate exactly 3 questions that are specifically tailored to THIS document's content. Be explicit of entities names, characters, etc.
- Each question should be modeled after the layer it belongs to. The questions can be redundant: for instance, asking for the subject of a paper's title even when the subject is explicit in the title. 
- Ensure questions are contextual to the document's overall topic, not on a specific section. If the author is talking about e.g. an artifact history but the main opinion of the author regards the authenticit of the artifact, be sure the question reflects this. 
- Use the document's specific terminology, entities, and concepts

Use the tool to return your 3 questions as a JSON array.
